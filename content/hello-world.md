Hello, hooman; this is the very beginning of this blog. :tada:

There's still plenty of customisation and things to set up, <strike>like comments using [Utterance](https://utteranc.es/)</strike>. And don't look at the **about me** page: it's still a lorem ipsum.

This blog will be about [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org), a bit of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (I'm in on its learning path), many command-line tools to automatise every aspect of a developer's life, [cats](https://typelevel.org/cats) :cat: in various forms and much other boring stuff. 

Cheers!

[EDIT] The comment system now uses [Giscus](https://giscus.app/) :smile:
