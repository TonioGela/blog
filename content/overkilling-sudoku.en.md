> This post was inspired by the Scala beginners' solution that Daniel [wrote](https://blog.rockthejvm.com/sudoku-backtracking/) and [recorded](https://youtu.be/zBLCbqycVzw) on his blog and Youtube channel **[Rock The JVM](https://rockthejvm.com/)**. I encourage you to read his blog post first if you are a Scala beginner, since it leverages mutability, resulting in a easier to understand solution that might give you the chance to get more familiar with the syntax of the language and with **recursion**.

# Introduction
[Sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku) is a notorious combinatorial puzzle solvable with optimised and efficient algorithms. Today we won't focus on any of those techniques, but we'll leverage the computing power of our machines to brute-force the solution in a **functional immutable fashion.**

The Scala community has many fantastic tools and libraries to help us synthesise the solution and package our solver in an **ultra-fast native executable with instant startup times** using our favourite language and its expressivity. To implement our solution, I chose [scala-cli](https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/) to structure the project and to compile it with [scala-native](https://scala-native.org/en/stable/), [decline](https://ben.kirw.in/decline/) to parse command line arguments and [cats](https://typelevel.org/cats/) for its purely functional approach.

Top-down or bottom-up, using the functional style, you can do both.
