There's plenty of `"How to install and use Haskell in VsCode in 202X"` tutorials on the internet but none of them never completely worked **FOR ME**. They're all either too verbose or showing configuration that, despite the tentatives and re-reading, isn't simply working for me (at least not as promised). Most of them are immensely exaustive on which _formatters_ to pick and why but contain just a couple of lines about `stack new` or how to use an **external library** in your build.

This tutorial is the tutorial that I **badly** needed when I began studying Haskell a few months ago, a tutorial that will hopefully explain you just the strictly needed information to begin programming in Haskell in an IDE with **autocompletion**, but also make you able to **pack your code in an executable** maybe using some **community libraries** too.

> DISCLAIMER: **This tutorial might contain imprecise information**. I will try to give a reference for each of my claims, but since I'm still a Haskell newbie, explanations might reflect the (possibly imprecise) way I understood things. Beign sure that VSCode works at the end of this tutorial is easy, **knowing exactly why is not**. I'll try to be as precise as possible and I ask you to correct me in the comments if you find anything that's simply wrong or not working.

## Step one: How about Haskell?

Install haskell with GHCup, then cabal, hls, 

#### What cabal is? What stack is?

#### Perche' non riesco ad usare le librerie? Se metto solo ghc come resolver non ho nulla dentro.
#### ghcup tui
#### Estensione vscode
#### Setup 
#### Stackage vs Hackage
#### Vedi su hackage se la lib esiste su hackage
#### formatter?
