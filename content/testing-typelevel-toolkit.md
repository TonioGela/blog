+++

The [Typelevel toolkit] is a metalibrary including some **great libraries** by [Typelevel] created to speed up the development of cross-platform applications in Scala. It's the Typelevel's flavour of the official [Scala Toolkit], a set of libraries to perform common programming tasks, that got its own section, full of examples, in the [official Scala documentation](https://docs.scala-lang.org/toolkit/introduction.html).

One of the vaunts of the Typelevel's stack is the fact that (almost) every library is published for the all the **three officially supported Scala platforms: JVM, JS and Native**, and for this reason every library is **heavily tested** against every supported platform and Scala version, to ensure a near perfect cross-compatibility.

Since its creation the [Typelevel toolkit] was lacking any sort of testing, mainly due to the fact that it is a mere collection of already battle tested libraries, so why bothering writing tests for it? As [this bug](https://github.com/typelevel/toolkit/issues/49) promptly reminded us, the main goal of the toolkit is to provide the most seamless experience while using [scala-cli]. 

Ideally you should be able to write:

{% codeBlock(title="helloWorld.scala") %}
```scala
//> using toolkit typelevel:latest

import cats.effect.*

object Hello extends IOApp.Simple:
  def run = IO.println("Hello World!")
```
{% end %}

specify any platform with `//> using platform {jvm,js,native}` and calling `scala-cli run helloWorld.scala` should **Just Workâ„¢** printing `"Hello World!"` to the console.

To be 100% sure we needed CI tests indeed.

## Planning the tests

What had to be tested though? All the included libraries are already tested, some of them are built using other included libraries, so some sort of **cross testing** was already done. What we were really interested in was always **being sure that scala-cli is always able to compile scripts written using the toolkit**. And what's the best way to ensure that `scala-cli` can compile a script written with the toolkit if not using `scala-cli` itself? 

`Pause for dramatic effect`

The coarse idea that [Arman](https://github.com/armanbilge) and I had in mind was to have a CI doing the following:
- **Locally publishing** the toolkit artifact
- Passing the artifact's version to a bunch of **pre-baked parametrized scripts**
- **Running** the scripts with `scala-cli`
- Be happy if every exit code is **0**

The **third step** in particular could have been implemented in a couple of ways:
1) Installing `scala-cli` in the CI image via GitHub Actions, call it from the tests code, and gather the results
2) Since `scala-cli` is a [native executable generated by GraalVM Native Image](https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/docs/under-the-hood) and the corresponding jvm artifact [is distributed](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/virtuslab/scala-cli/cli_3/), using it as a dependency and calling its main method in the tests.

We decided to follow the latter, as we didn't want to **mangle the GitHub Actions CI file** or relying on the **timely publication of the updated scala-cli GitHub Action**. Also, [sbt] is a superb tool for instrument this kind of tests.

> **BONUS EXAMPLE**: Using `scala-cli` in `scala-cli` to compile a `scala-cli` script
>{% codeBlock(title="recursiveScalaCli.scala", color="green") %}
```scala
//> using dep org.virtuslab.scala-cli::cli::1.0.4

import scala.cli.ScalaCli

object ScalaCliApp extends App:
    ScalaCli.main(Array("compile", "foo.scala"))
```
{%end%}

### First tentative: using the dependency in tests

"Unspoken rule about the Scala community"

{% codeBlock(title="build.sbt") %}
```scala
//...
lazy val tests = project
  .in(file("tests"))
  .settings(
    name := "tests",
    Test / test := (Test / test).dependsOn(toolkit.jvm / publishLocal).value,
    scalacOptions ++= {
      if (scalaBinaryVersion.value == "2.13") Seq("-Ytasty-reader") else Nil
    },
    libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
      "org.typelevel" %% "munit-cats-effect" % "2.0.0-M3" % Test,
      "co.fs2" %% "fs2-io" % "3.9.2" % Test,
      "org.virtuslab.scala-cli" %% "cli" % "1.0.4" % Test cross (CrossVersion.for2_13Use3)
    )
  )
  .enablePlugins(BuildInfoPlugin, NoPublishPlugin)
//...
```
{%end%}


{% codeBlock(title="ToolkitTests.scala") %}
```scala
  def testRun(testName: String)(scriptBody: String): Unit = {
    test(testName)(
      Files[IO]
        .tempFile(None, "", "-toolkit.scala", None)
        .use { path =>
            val header = List(
              s"//> using scala ${BuildInfo.scalaVersion}",
              s"//> using toolkit typelevel:${BuildInfo.version}",
            ).mkString("", "\n", "\n")
          Stream(header, scriptBody.stripMargin)
            .through(Files[IO].writeUtf8(path))
            .compile
            .drain >> IO.delay(
            ScalaCli.main(Array("run", path.toString))
          )
        }
    )
  }
```
{%end%}

- scala-cli in GH non ci piaceva, implementare test esternamente
- artifact publishing
- primo tentativo jvm only con il classpath
- Idea con BuildInfo
- Trasformare runtime error in compile errors
- cross platform con fs2, invocando java e dichiarando male la dipendenza
