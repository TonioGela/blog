Hello hooman, this is the very beginning of this blog. :tada:

There's still plenty of customization to do and things to set up, like comments using [Utterance](https://utteranc.es/). And don't look at the **about me** page: it's still a lorem ipsum.

This blog will be about [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org), a bit of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (I'm in on its learning path), many command-line tools to automatize every aspect of a developer's life, cats :cat: in various forms (like the [statically checked one](https://typelevel.org/cats/)) and a lot of other boring stuff. 

Cheers!
