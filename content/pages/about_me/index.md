I'm Antonio Gelameris, a {{ resize_image(path="pages/about_me/scala.png", width=15, height=15, op="fit") }} [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) developer currently working at {{ resize_image(path="pages/about_me/pagopa.png", width=15, height=15, op="fit") }} [PagoPA S.p.A.](https://github.com/pagopa)

I began this blog mainly for **two** reasons:

- I might occasionally have something to say about languages and tools I use every day
- I don't care if anyone reads it or not

I'm a former **physicist**, so I sometimes bother people claiming it, and half **Italian** half **Greek**, so I often bother people

**Fun fact**: I **knit** and **crochet** :yarn: sometimes nerdy stuff like [Haskell hats](https://twitter.com/VadimBakaev/status/1392210564882046978)

**Also-fun fact**: I own a really serious :cat: called Galileo

If you want to get in touch with me, the best place is probably {{ resize_image(path="pages/about_me/twitter.png", width=15, height=15, op="fit") }} [Twitter](https://twitter.com/toniogela), but if you're Italian you might want to consider the {{ resize_image(path="pages/about_me/discord.png", width=15, height=15, op="fit") }} [Scala Italy Discord](https://discord.gg/8wadTgcZVt)
